# ecs-hours

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## About

This application is used to record the hours worked during the week.

## Inspiration

Tired of manually sending weekly timetable emails, I developed this application to automate the process.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
